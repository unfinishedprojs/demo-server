# Demo-Server functionality

Messy project, dont try to make sense of it

- Implement actual Oceanic.js code to create Invites (hopefully once this is done I finally push to github)

- Fix login, as it is currently disabled

- Create query endpoints for the frontend to use (and for any additional clients)
