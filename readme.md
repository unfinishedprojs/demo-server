# Demo-Server functionality

Messy project, dont try to make sense of it

## TODO

- When CEvent is finished, check if IEvent already exists. If it does, check if it ended. If it ended and is positive, do not allow new CEvents for user. If it ended and is negative, allow new CEvents for user

- Modify Response so that it doesn't leak backend info

- Make Token a header
